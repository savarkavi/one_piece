            <div class="luffy">
                <span>Monkey D. Luffy</span>: Monkey D. Luffy (モンキー・D・ルフィ, Monkī Dī Rufi) is the main
                protagonist of the One Piece series. At age seven, he admires and tries to join the pirates
                of the "Red Haired" Shanks. Ridiculed and rejected, he inadvertently eats their treasure,
                the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit (ゴムゴムの実, Gomu Gomu no Mi), which gives him rubbery
                attributes. His reckless efforts ultimately lead him into grave peril causing Shanks to
                lose an arm while rescuing him. After this, Luffy gives up on joining Shanks, resolving
                instead to start a crew of his own and become King of the Pirates.[ch. 1] Displeased by
                Shanks spoiling his grandson, Garp takes Luffy to be raised by Curly Dadan and her
                mountain bandits, who he strong-arms into taking him in. During Luffy's time there,
                he becomes a sworn brother with Ace, Garp's other ward, and Sabo, a local runaway noble.

            <div class="zoro">
                <span>Roronoa Zoro</span>: Roronoa Zoro (ロロノア・ゾロ) is a swordsman who uses up to three
                swords simultaneously, holding one in each hand and a third in his mouth.[ch. 3, 5, 28] To
                fulfill a promise to Kuina, his deceased childhood friend and rival, he aims to defeat
                "Hawk Eye" Mihawk and become the world's greatest swordsman to fulfill a promise from his
                childhood friend.[ch. 5, 50] Traveling the seas in search of Mihawk and making a living
                as a bounty hunter, he becomes infamously known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro (海賊狩りのゾロ,
                Kaizoku-Gari no Zoro).
            </div>
            <div class="nami">
                <span>Nami</span>: Adopted and raised by navy seaman turned tangerine farmer Belle-Mère,
                Nami (ナミ) witness their mother being murdered by the infamous Arlong, whose pirate gang
                occupies their island and extracts tribute from the population. Striking a deal with him,
                Nami, still a child, but already an accomplished cartographer who dreams of drawing a
                complete map of the world, joins the pirates, hoping to buy freedom for her village
                eventually. Growing up as a pirate-hating pirate drawing maps for Arlong and stealing
                treasure from other pirates, Nami becomes an excellent burglar, pickpocket, and
                navigator with an exceptional ability to forecast weather.[ch. 77, 95, 130] After
                Arlong betrays her, and he and his gang are defeated by the Straw Hat Pirates, Nami
                joins them in pursuit of her dream and acquires infamy herself as "Cat Burglar"
                Nami (泥棒猫のナミ, Dorobō Neko no Nami)
            </div>
            <div class="usopp">
                <span>Usopp</span>: During his early childhood, Usopp (ウソップ, Usoppu) is abandoned by
                his father, Yasopp, who leaves to join the Red-Haired Pirates. As his mother, Bachina,
                falls ill, Usopp starts telling tall tales, expressing his hope that his father will
                return and take them out to sea. He regularly goes to the mansion at the top of the
                hill where he lives, to visit Kaya. Even after his mother dies, Usopp does not blame
                his father for leaving. Despite his cowardly disposition, he strives to become a great pirate.

            <div class="sanji">
                <span>Sanji</span>: Born as a prince of Germa Kingdom, Vinsmoke Sanji (ヴィンスモーク・サンジ,
                Vinsumōku Sanji) is routinely ridiculed by his genetically enhanced siblings and is locked
                away by his father Judge for being a disgrace. With help from his sister Reiju, he escapes
                and flees Germa, a floating kingdom composed of several ships, after it enters the East
                Blue and his father permits it. While serving as an apprentice cook on a passenger ship,
                nine-year-old Sanji stands up to a boarding party of pirates led by the infamous "Red Foot"
                Zeff. During the encounter, Sanji is swept into the sea by a massive wave. Zeff jumps
                in after him because of their common dream of finding the All Blue (オールブルー, Ōru Burū),
                a legendary area where the East, West, North, and South Blue seas meet, containing every
                kind of fish in the world. While castaways together, the pirate saves Sanji's life yet
                again by giving him all of their food. After their eventual rescue, Sanji stays with
                Zeff for several years and helps him build a floating restaurant, the Baratie
                (バラティエ). Zeff in turn makes him a first-rate cook and teaches him his kick-based
                fighting style. Mirroring Zeff, Sanji will never refuse a starving
                person a meal, and he uses only his legs when fighting to protect the hands he
                needs for cooking. He has a weakness for women and makes it a 
                principle never to harm one, even if it means his death.

            <div class="chopper">
                <span>Tony Tony Chopper</span>: Tony Tony Chopper (トニートニー・チョッパー, Tonī Tonī Choppā)
                is a doctor and a blue-nosed reindeer. The power of the Zoan-type Human-Human Fruit
                (ヒトヒトの実, Hito Hito no Mi) provides him with the ability to transform into a full-sized
                reindeer or a reindeer-human hybrid.[ch. 140] A self-developed drug he calls Rumble Ball
                (ランブル・ボール, Ranburu Bōru) enables him to perform even more transformations for three
                minutes.[ch. 149] With help from Caesar Clown, Chopper can last in his transformations
                for about 30 minutes.
