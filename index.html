            <p> One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda.
                It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997,
                with its individual chapters compiled into 103 tankōbon volumes as of August 2022. The story follows 
                the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after 
                unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores 
                the Grand Line in search of the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known 
                as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates. 

                One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. It has received
                many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time.
                Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run
                published for the same comic book series by a single author". It was the best-selling manga for 
                eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only manga that had an initial print of volum
                than 1 million copies sold in all of its over 100 published tankōbon volumes. One Piece is the only 
                manga whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence since 2008.
